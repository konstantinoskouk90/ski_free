# Ski Free - TypeScript Edition

**How To Play**

* Use the arrow keys to turn the Skier.
* Use the space bar to jump over rocks.
* Colliding with a jump ramp causes the Skier to jump.
* The Skier will crash if they hit a tree. Use the left/right keys to move away from the trees and then down
to resume skiing.
* At some point the Rhino will appear, chasing the Skier. It will inevitably catch the Skier and eat them, ending the
game.
